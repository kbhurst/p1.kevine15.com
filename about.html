						   My name is Kevin Hurst.  I'm relatively new to web applications and designs.  The last class I took was about two years ago so there was a lot I forgot.  This exercise brought back a lot of what I forgot.  I currently live in a town called Syracuse, UT which is 30 miles north of Salt Lake City, and is boardered in the west by the Great Salt Lake.  In the past I've lived in Arizona and Washington state where a lot of my family currently lives.  My current job is with a firm that performs valuations on real estate throughout the country using computer modeling.  It turns out that it is incredibly difficult to get accurate valuations of properties so many companies want a consistent and historial estimate of values.  I'm an IT manager there where I deal with the business side and managerial side.  Given the amount of web development that takes place here I thought this would be an ideal class to learn more than the little I currently know.
